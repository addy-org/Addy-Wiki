We understand that the template has a lot of questions but this is a very important step in the process. It will not only help us know more about you and find a good fit but will force you to think to think about the project idea in great detail. By working on this proposal, you will already be taking your first steps towards a successful summer. We recommend that you start early and iterate on the application by getting feedback from the mentor. Please remember that you must submit your application to Google's GSoC portal. It is not possible to accept you if you do not do this. Please make sure your application follows the template.
