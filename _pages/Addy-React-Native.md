A React Native based app for Addy

[Addy](https://github.com/addy-org/Addy) is a web app that enhances the addressing system of the world. Instead of remembering long addresses, Addy generates a unique 7-digit code based on the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of any position. The code is so accurate that every building in the world has been assigned a different 'Addy' with a minimum distance of 11.132 meters.
